// Problem: A baseball team has a name and a roster of players. Modify your
// solution to "players.cpp"---create a new struct type `baseball_team`,
// which has a (dynamic) array of baseball_player instances and a name (string).
// Create an array of exactly two teams, and populate them using inputs from
// the user.
