Upcasting: Casting an object of a derived type to its base type (or any of its ancestor types)

Object slicing: What happens when you upcast objects directly---the derived class's specific data gets "sliced off"

Polymorphism: A single variable being capable of representing one of multiple types of objects. In C++, this is done by upcasting pointers or references to avoid object slicing.

Binding: Looking at a function call, and deciding WHICH function to call

Early binding: Binding that the compiler does
/ Static dispatch

Late binding: At runtime, based on the DYNAMIC TYPE of an object, decide which function should be called when we call a member function on it
/ Dynamic dispatch

Abstract class: Any class with one or more pure virtual functions. You cannot create instances of an abstract class
